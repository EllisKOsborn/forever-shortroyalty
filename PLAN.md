## 1. Changes to the original brief (pushback)

| # | You asked for | Problem | What I propose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A new repo `EllisKOsborn/short-kings-addon` | This session can only reach `elliskosborn/forever-shortkings`, which is empty and ready to use. | Use `forever-shortkings`. The in-game folder will still be called `ShortRoyalty`, because the release zip sets that, not the repo name. |
| 2 | Key characters by **Name-Realm** | Forever has **no realms**. Names are two-part (first name + surname) and unique across the region. The exact `sender` format in addon messages is not documented. | Key every character by its **player GUID**, which is stable and unique, and show the roster name. `/sr debug` prints the real formats so we can check them in game. |
| 3 | Data for **all characters on the account** | An addon can only read a character while you are logged in as it. | Each alt is recorded the first time you log in as it, and again on every later login. The window shows "last updated" for each one. |
| 4 | Every client sends a manifest of **every** character every few minutes | With 100 members that is 100 × 100 entries going round guild chat. It grows with the square of guild size and risks throttling. | Each client announces **only its own account's characters**. For members who are offline, a new arrival sends one query when it logs in, and a single peer (chosen with a random delay) offers to fill the gaps. Traffic grows in step with guild size. |
| 5 | "Which recipes **nobody** has" | That needs a list of every recipe that exists. Forever adds 600+ recipes, and no verified list has been published. | Build the list from what members see: when anyone opens a profession window, record **unlearned** recipes too, not only learned ones. "All recipes" = everything any member has seen. The list grows as people scan. Caveat: this depends on the Forever profession window showing unlearned recipes, which I'll check in game. |
| 6 | Reputations with "the major raid factions" | Forever adds new raids (Barrow Deeps, Hyjal Summit), so its factions may differ from Classic. Hard-coding Classic faction IDs would be guessing. | Record **every** faction the character can see. A short highlight list (`Data/Factions.lua`) marks each entry as *verified* or *TODO*. |
| 7 | Attunements table | Only the Onyxia attunement is confirmed for Forever. Raids open on 9 Dec, and Molten Core isn't in the first wave. | Fill in only the quest IDs I can check against two sources, and mark everything else **TODO**. No guessed IDs. |
| 8 | Pause in **raids and dungeons** | Battlegrounds and arenas are instances too, and Midnight's chat-lockdown rules can block addon messages at other times. | Pause in **every** instance type, in combat, and whenever `C_ChatInfo.InChatMessagingLockdown()` is true. Messages wait in a queue and send later. |
| 9 | Show trial members as "can't sync" | Other players can't see from outside that someone is on a trial. A trial member and a member without the addon look the same. | The roster shows **"No data (no addon / trial)"**. On a trial player's own screen, the addon shows a clear notice and turns sending off. |
| 10 | Crafters tab | Forever's Blizzard UI already includes Blizzard's own guild crafter lookup (`C_GuildInfo.QueryGuildMembersForRecipe`). | Keep our tab, because it works for offline members and can search by item name. `/sr debug` reports whether Blizzard's version is turned on. |
| 11 | Talents | Forever's talent window runs on the modern trait system (`C_Traits`), drawn as Classic-style trees. | Store points per tree (e.g. 31/20/0) plus the talent spell IDs and ranks, so anyone can see names and icons whatever their class. |

AceComm-3.0 (+ ChatThrottleLib), LibSerialize, LibDeflate, LibDataBroker-1.1,
LibDBIcon-1.0. Ace3 comes from **trunk**, because the tagged release doesn't
list 16001 or include the 12.x lockdown fixes.

---

## 3. Data schema (`ShortRoyaltyDB`, account-wide)

```lua
ShortRoyaltyDB = {
  schema   = 1,
  settings = { sync = true, debug = false,
               minimap = { hide = false },
               window  = { point = "CENTER", x = 0, y = 0, scale = 1 } },
  account  = { [guid] = true },          -- characters seen on THIS account
  guilds   = {
    ["<guild name>"] = {
      members  = { [guid] = { name, class, level, rank, online,
                               lastSeen, leftAt } },      -- from the roster
      profiles = { [guid] = Profile },
      recipeUniverse = { [skillLineID] = { [recipeID] = outputItemID or 0 } },
    },
  },
}

Profile = {
  v = 1, guid, name, class, race, level,
  updated = <server time>, addon = "0.1.0", hash = <adler32>,
  source  = "owner" | "relay",          -- local bookkeeping only, never sent
  family  = { guid, ... },              -- alts this owner says are theirs
  gear    = { [slotID] = "item:..." },  -- item strings, tooltips work from these
  ilvl    = 0,
  talents = { trees = { { name, points, icon } },
              nodes = { [spellID] = rank } },
  profs   = { [skillLineID] = { name, rank, max, scanned = ts|nil } },
  recipes = { [skillLineID] = { recipeID, ... } },        -- learned only
  cds     = { [recipeID] = expiresAt },                   -- server time
  reps    = { [factionID] = { standing, value } },
  att     = { [attunementKey] = true|false },
}
```

Size estimate: a crafter with two professions comes to about 2–4 KB
after compression. That's roughly 10–20 addon messages, which go out at
BULK priority.

---

## 4. Sync protocol

Prefix `ShortRoyalty`. Every message is a serialised table
`{ t = type, p = protocolVersion, ... }`. Clients ignore messages that
carry a newer major protocol version.

| Type | Channel | Sent when | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HI` | GUILD | login (+10–20 s jitter), every 10 min, 60 s after own data changes | my account's characters: `{guid, updated, hash}` |
| `RQ` | WHISPER | after a `HI`/`SO` shows something missing or stale | `{ want = {guid, ...} }` |
| `PR` | WHISPER | in reply to `RQ` | one profile per message |
| `SQ` | GUILD | once per session, ~60 s after login | `{guid, updated}` for every profile I hold |
| `SO` | GUILD | a peer has newer copies than the `SQ` listed; random 2–8 s delay, cancelled if someone else offers first | `{ holder, guids }` |

**Merge rules (enforced in `Sync.lua`, covered by tests):**
1. Drop any profile whose GUID isn't in the current guild roster. If the
   roster hasn't loaded yet, hold the message until it has.
2. Drop it if `updated` is more than 5 minutes in the future.
3. Drop it if the hash doesn't match the payload.
4. **Owner copy** (the sender *is* that character, or is listed in its
   `family` as last stated by the character itself): accept it if
   `updated >= stored.updated`.
5. **Relay copy**: accept it only if `updated > stored.updated`. A relay
   therefore can never overwrite a newer owner copy.

**Safety:** all sends go through ChatThrottleLib (BULK for profiles, NORMAL
for the rest). Sending pauses when `InCombatLockdown()`, `IsInInstance()`
or `C_ChatInfo.InChatMessagingLockdown()` is true. ChatThrottleLib drops
lockdown failures, so the addon keeps its own retry queue. Incoming data
is buffered during combat and processed afterwards. Trial accounts
(`IsTrialAccount` / `IsVeteranTrialAccount` / `IsRestrictedAccount`)
never send.

**Pruning:** a member who disappears from a *fully loaded*, non-empty
roster gets `leftAt = now`. Their data is deleted after 30 days, and the
timer clears if they rejoin.

---

## 5. APIs checked against Forever 1.60.1.70532

✅ = in Blizzard's generated API docs, or called by Blizzard's own Forever
UI code. ❓ = has to be confirmed in game; the addon checks for it at
runtime and copes if it's missing.

| Need | API | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Interface number | `select(4, GetBuildInfo())` → 16001 | ✅ (beta value; confirm on live) |
| Addon messages | `C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage` (returns a result enum), `RegisterAddonMessagePrefix`, `CHAT_MSG_ADDON` | ✅ |
| Lockdown | `C_ChatInfo.InChatMessagingLockdown`, `AreOutgoingAddonChatMessagesRestricted` | ✅ |
| Secret values | `issecretvalue`, `canaccessvalue` | ✅ (used as guards) |
| Trial | `IsTrialAccount`, `IsVeteranTrialAccount`, `IsRestrictedAccount` | ✅ |
| Professions list | `GetProfessions`, `GetProfessionInfo` | ✅ used by Forever's ProfessionsBook |
| Skill lines | `C_SkillInfo.GetNumSkillLines/GetSkillLineInfo` | ✅ used by Forever's SkillsFrame (the wiki listed these as removed; the 70532 source still has them) |
| Recipe list | `C_TradeSkillUI.GetFilteredRecipeIDs` ✅, `GetAllRecipeIDs` ❓ | not in the generated docs; Blizzard's UI calls `GetFilteredRecipeIDs` |
| Recipe info | `C_TradeSkillUI.GetRecipeInfo`, `GetRecipeOutputItemData`, `GetBaseProfessionInfo` | ✅ |
| Skip other people's windows | `C_TradeSkillUI.IsTradeSkillLinked/IsTradeSkillGuild/IsNPCCrafting` | ✅ used by Blizzard's UI |
| Cooldowns | `C_TradeSkillUI.GetRecipeCooldown` | ✅ used by Blizzard's UI (works only while the window is open) |
| Classic fallback | `GetTradeSkillInfo`, `GetCraftInfo`, … | ❌ not in this build; kept only as a defensive fallback |
| Talents | `C_SpecializationInfo.GetCombatConfigIDForSpecGroup`, `C_ClassTalents.GetActiveConfigID`, `C_Traits.GetConfigInfo/GetTreeNodes/GetNodeInfo/GetEntryInfo/GetDefinitionInfo/GetGroupDisplayInfoByTreeID` | ✅ used by Forever's ClassTalents frame |
| Gear | `GetInventoryItemLink`, `GetAverageItemLevel` | ✅ used by Forever's PaperDollFrame |
| Reputation | `C_Reputation.GetNumFactions/GetFactionDataByIndex/GetFactionDataByID` | ✅ |
| Quests | `C_QuestLog.IsQuestFlaggedCompleted` | ✅ |
| Guild roster | `C_GuildInfo.GuildRoster`, `GetNumGuildMembers`/`GetGuildRosterInfo` ❓, fallback `C_Club.GetGuildClubId/GetClubMembers/GetMemberInfo` ✅ | Forever's guild UI uses C_Club |
| Server time | `GetServerTime` | ✅ |

**Open questions only the game can answer** (all printed by `/sr debug`):
- What `sender` looks like in `CHAT_MSG_ADDON` with two-part names.
- Whether `GetGuildRosterInfo` still exists and returns GUIDs.
- Whether the profession window shows unlearned recipes.
- Whether player GUIDs stay the same across sessions. The wiki says only
  creature, pet and object GUIDs are obfuscated.
- The live TOC number after the 4 Nov launch.

---

## 6. Raid sign-ups (added 1 Nov)

**Recommendation: build on Blizzard's in-game calendar instead of making our own.**

Forever ships Blizzard's full calendar (`C_Calendar`, `Blizzard_Calendar`).
Its own code lets **any guild member create a "Guild Event"** (a sign-up
event). Only ranks with the "edit guild event" permission can create
"Guild Announcements". So **no custom roles are needed**: anyone can
already create a raid, and only the creator (or officers) can edit it.

Why build on it:
- Events live on Blizzard's servers. They're there when the creator is
  offline, and members **without the addon** can still sign up.
- No sync conflicts, and no one can fake, spam or delete other people's events.
- Addon code isn't allowed to create events (`C_Calendar.AddEvent` is
  flagged as restricted), so the **"New raid" button opens Blizzard's calendar**.

What our **Raids tab** adds:
- Upcoming guild sign-up events for the next 30 days.
- For each event, everyone who signed up: name (class colour), status
  (signed up / tentative / declined), **role**, **spec** (main talent tree
  + points, e.g. "Holy 31/20/0"), item level and attunement for that raid.
- Counts per role (e.g. "Tanks 2 · Healers 6 · DPS 18") and missing roles.
- **Role**: Blizzard's sign-up records no role. Each member picks
  Tank/Healer/DPS in our tab. The default comes from their talent tree
  (`Data/Roles.lua`), and the choice is shared as a small owner-only
  `RL` message `{eventID, guid, role, updated}`. Members without the
  addon show a greyed-out guess based on their spec.
- Sign-up / Tentative / Decline buttons, if the game lets addons press
  them. If it doesn't, the button opens Blizzard's calendar on that event.

Check in game: whether `eventID` is the same on every client; whether
sign-up calls are protected; and reading the sign-up list needs
`C_Calendar.OpenEvent`, so we only read it while Blizzard's calendar window
is closed, to avoid interfering with it.

**Refined 2 Nov (checked against the 1.60.1 calendar docs)** — the build
prompt is `docs/prompts/next-v0.4-raids.md`:
- Each sign-up (`CalendarEventInviteInfo`) includes the player's **GUID**,
  name, class, level and status, so line-ups key cleanly by GUID.
- Blizzard's statuses are Invited, Available, Declined, Confirmed, Out,
  Standby, Signed up, Not signed up and Tentative. There is **no "late"**
  status and **no role** field. "Bench" = Standby (set by the event's moderators).
- Roles: a **main and second role in the profile** instead of a per-event
  `RL` message. It needs no new protocol and works when people are offline.
  Per-event overrides can come later.
- Only `AddEvent` is flagged `HasRestrictions`. The sign-up calls
  (`EventSignUp`, `EventTentative`, `EventDecline`, `EventAvailable`) are
  not, but are still only called from button presses.
- `GetDayEvent` and `EventGetInvite` return secret values during chat
  lockdown, so read them only when sync isn't paused.
- Raid templates (C5) become a raid table (name, size, title keywords)
  used to match events to raids, since the addon can't create events.
- Two releases: **v0.3.0** read-only (events, line-up, roles, counts,
  attunement) and **v0.3.1** actions (sign-up buttons, reminders, invite all).

*Alternative, not recommended:* addon-only events. Anyone could create
them with no roles, but members without the addon can't see them,
someone has to be online to share them, and they're easy to spam.

## 7. Milestones and future plans

Item IDs (A1, B1 …) refer to [docs/FEATURE-REVIEW.md](docs/FEATURE-REVIEW.md),
which explains where each idea came from.

### Done (awaiting in-game test)
- **v0.1**: collection, sync, Roster/Character/Settings tabs, `/sk`,
  `/sr debug`, minimap button, theme, tests, CI, packager.
- **v0.1.1**:
  - A1 status dots (online with addon / without / offline)
  - A2 alts grouped under their main (mutually confirmed), "Make this my main"
  - A3 public and officer notes (officer only where allowed, never synced)
  - A4 addon version column and "needs an update"
  - A5 missing-enchant markers
  - A6 cooldowns refreshed from the spell API
  - A7 privacy toggles (share gear/talents, share recipes)
- **v0.1.2** (guild requests):
  - raid attunement filter on the Roster (Attuned column, filters, counter, max level only)
  - "Ask for latest" on the Character tab (RQ by whisper; the owner rebuilds first)
  - faster updates (`HI` 30 s after a change instead of 60 s)
- **v0.2.0**:
  - Crafters tab: search a recipe or item, see who can make it, Whisper, post to guild chat (B7)
  - B1 "Crafted by" lines on every item tooltip (`TooltipDataProcessor`)

### Agreed roadmap (revised 2 Nov 2026 after the GPT, Manus and Perplexity reviews)

How each proposal was judged: [docs/PLAN-REVIEW.md](docs/PLAN-REVIEW.md). This
section is the single source of truth for order and status.

- **v0.2.1 launch readiness** — ✅ code complete 2 Nov. No new message types:
  - attunement fix: Barrow Deeps and Hyjal need none; Onyxia quest **and**
    Drakefire Amulet in bags; MC/BWL/Naxx hidden from the picker
  - `/sr debug`: last errors, calendar probes, GUID stability, unlearned recipes
  - sync hardening: 32 KB message cap, per-sender rate limit
  - sharing preview in Settings; clearer "relayed / stale / not scanned" labels
  - Copy as text (Roster, Crafters) for Discord (D8)
  - "update available" in the Roster counter
- **v0.2.2 Overview** — ✅ code complete 2 Nov (moved ahead of the test gate
  at the owner's request; read-only, no protocol change): Overview tab with
  Guild, Raids, Data health, Professions (B5 coverage), Recipes
  (single-crafter) and Recent milestones (P7, local only, never synced).
- **Test gate** (4–7 Nov): owner runs TESTING.md; **v0.2.3** = fixes only,
  plus an API contract check in CI (P17).
- **Reordered 5 Nov (owner): the guild says professions matter most.**
  **v0.3 Professions** comes first (`docs/prompts/next-v0.3-professions.md`):
  coverage board, one-profession view, specialisations (original-game ones
  only), cooldown board, reagents, favourites, freshness nudges. Craft
  requests (D1) are an optional v0.3.1.
- **v0.4 Raids** (still before 9 Dec): `docs/prompts/next-v0.4-raids.md`, plus a
  readiness card (P11) and a duplicate-alt sign-up check. Addon-native events
  (P13) only if the calendar turns out to be unusable.
- ~~v0.4 Professions~~: moved to v0.3 (see above); camp planner (P6) still
  waits for verified data.
- **v0.5 Coordination** (Jan): craft requests (D1), status line (P8),
  lockout board (P15).
- **v0.6 Polish:** ember animation, long spec names, two-column Character tab.

### Later (in rough priority order)
(D1 craft requests moved to v0.5; D8 export moved to v0.2.1.)
- Per-step Onyxia attunement tracker (P10), once its quest IDs are verified
- Legacy/guild goals (P16, Manus stage 4), if the client exposes them
- Officer announcements and short guild notes (GPT 4.7, kept small)
- D2 raid attendance from the raid group (30/60/90 days)
- D6 shopping list and reagent totals
- D5 guild bank snapshot viewer (only if the guild uses the bank)
- D3 loot history of epic drops. Check Midnight restrictions on loot events
  in raids first, and consider recommending Gargul instead
- D7 `!sk <item>` guild-chat lookup for members without the addon. Only if
  Forever allows automatic guild-chat replies (`SendChatMessage` is restricted)
- D4 missing recipes with where to get them (needs a recipe-source table)
- D9 guild fun events (raffles, fishing derby, contests)
- CurseForge release: **in progress (6 Nov)**, steps in `docs/CURSEFORGE.md`

### Not planned (and why)
Loot council, DKP and soft reserves (use Gargul); consumable and world-buff
checks (Party Buff Tracker Forever, and Midnight blocks reading auras in
raids); officer kick/promote scripts (GRM); replacing Blizzard's guild window
(taint risk); website or Discord sync (against the brief); layers, bounties,
blacklists and group finder (not useful for a PvE guild of 50); addon-observed
activity metrics (feel like surveillance, and the roster already shows last
online); a Retail version (the guild plays Forever); a stronger hash (nothing
secret is synced).

## 8. Decisions so far

- Licence: **MIT**.
- Guild size about **50**, so sync timings assume 50 online at most
  (`HI` every 10 min = ~5 small guild messages a minute in total).
- Libraries: LibStub, CallbackHandler, AceComm + ChatThrottleLib (Ace3
  trunk, BSD), LibSerialize (MIT) and LibDeflate (zlib) are **committed in
  `Libs/`**, with their licence files, so tests use the real code. LibDataBroker
  and LibDBIcon are pulled in by the packager (`.pkgmeta` externals). Without
  them the addon falls back to its own simple minimap button.
- Mac AddOns path: **still to confirm** (Battle.net → Forever → ⚙ → Show in Finder).

## 9. Credits / licence

No code copied from other guild-sync addons (Perpetua, ForeverArtisan and
others were not read for code). API facts come from warcraft.wiki.gg,
Blizzard's UI source as mirrored by Gethe/wow-ui-source, and public notes in
the Everloot and bff-wow GitHub issues and PRs. These are credited in
README.md.

## 10. Once Forever is live (from 4 Nov 2026)

Everything up to v0.2.2 is built but has only run against a simulated
client. This is the order of work once the game is live. Nothing new gets
built until steps 1 to 3 are done.

### Step 1: first evening on your own (about 30 minutes)
1. Download **ShortRoyalty-v0.2.2.zip** from the GitHub **Releases** page
   (under *Assets*). Unzip it so you have `AddOns/ShortRoyalty/ShortRoyalty.toc`
   (path in the README's Install section). Share the same link with the guild.
2. Character screen → **AddOns**: Short Royalty is listed and not "out of date"
   (if it is, tick *Load out of date AddOns* and tell me).
3. In game, type `/console scriptErrors 1` once so Lua errors show.
4. Type `/dump select(4, GetBuildInfo())` and note the number (expect 16001).
5. Open each of your **profession windows** once, and open the **Calendar** once.
6. Type `/sr debug`, copy everything and send it to me. The parts that matter
   most are **"Live-client checks"**, any **"missing:"** lines and
   **"Recent errors"**.
7. Log out and back in on the same character, then `/sr debug` again (checks
   that your character's ID stays the same).
8. Work through TESTING.md items 1–15 and 22–29 (on your own), plus 50–66.

### Step 2: with one guildmate who also has the addon
TESTING.md items 16–21, 30–49: you see each other's data, Ask for latest,
Crafters and tooltips, Copy, the Overview's numbers and milestones.

### Step 3: what your report decides

| Check (from `/sr debug`) | If it's fine | If not |
|---|---|---|
| Interface number is 16001 | nothing to do | change `## Interface:` in `ShortRoyalty.toc`, new build |
| No Lua errors | carry on | fix them first (v0.2.3) |
| "missing:" API lines | carry on | replace or drop what uses them (v0.2.3) |
| You and a guildmate see each other's data | carry on | fix sync before anything else (sender format, roster names) |
| GUID stable between logins | carry on | stop and redesign how characters are identified |
| Profession window lists unlearned recipes | "recipes nobody has" goes into v0.3 | drop that idea; keep coverage and single-crafter counts |
| Calendar present and guild events listed | build v0.4 Raids on Blizzard's calendar | plan addon-only raid events instead (Perplexity P13) before building |
| Drakefire Amulet line resolves | carry on | fix the amulet check |

### Step 4: build queue after the test
1. **v0.2.3: fixes only** from steps 1–3, plus an automatic check in CI that
   every game function we use still exists in Blizzard's Forever code (P17).
2. **Release v0.2.3** with the fixes (v0.2.2, released 2 Nov, is the launch
   build). When you have CurseForge or Wago accounts, releases can go there
   too (P5); I prepare it, you do the upload.
3. **v0.3 Professions** (moved first on 5 Nov: the guild says professions
   matter most). Built 5 Nov (v0.3.0), waiting for the in-game test. Plan:
   section 11. Prompt:
   `docs/prompts/next-v0.3-professions.md`.
4. **v0.4.0 Raids, read-only** (target: before raids open on 9 Dec): raid
   events from the calendar, who signed up with role, spec, item level and
   attunement, role counts, readiness card, Copy. Prompt:
   `docs/prompts/next-v0.4-raids.md`.
5. **v0.4.1 Raids actions:** Sign up / Tentative / Decline buttons, a
   reminder before raids, and "invite everyone signed up" for the raid leader.
6. **v0.5 Coordination** (January): craft requests, a short status line,
   lockout board.

### Step 5: things the guild can find out in game (they unblock later ideas)
- **Onyxia attunement quest IDs** for each step (Wowhead Forever pages show
  them): unlocks the step-by-step attunement tracker (P10).
- **Camping objects**: which professions make which camp objects, at what
  skill, and how they're learned: unlocks the camp planner (P6).
- **Raid lockouts**: whether `/dump GetNumSavedInstances()` returns a number
  after a dungeon (it isn't in the 1.60.1 docs): decides the lockout board (P15).
- **Horde members**: if there are any, their Onyxia chain is different.
- What players ask for in the first two weeks. Real requests beat any plan.

## 11. v0.3 Professions plan (5 Nov 2026, **approved**: "do all of them")

The owner approved all six features on 5 Nov, before the v0.2.7 answers,
and asked that the "reopen" reminders are rare. So v0.3.0 is built to
check each unknown at runtime and hide what the game doesn't support:
"Nobody knows" appears only if the window lists unlearned recipes;
reagents show only if the game returns them; a specialisation counts only
if the game's own spell name matches. Once the v0.2.7 answers arrive,
record them in CLAUDE.md and adjust (e.g. set confirmed spec IDs to
`status = "ok"`).

### Step 1 facts (v0.2.7 probes; answers go into CLAUDE.md)
| Question | Probe line in `/sr debug` | If yes | If no |
|---|---|---|---|
| Window lists unlearned recipes? | "Last scan: … (unlearned listed: YES)" + the "show unlearned" filter | add the *Nobody knows* filter | drop it; keep single-crafter counts |
| Reagents readable with the window **closed**, and for unknown recipes? | "Reagents, a recipe you know / don't know" | read locally, cache in SavedVariables, never synced | readable only while open: cache what each player's own scan sees, still local; propose sync design only if even that fails |
| Specialisation spells known? | "Specialisations" (known=, client name=) | IDs become `status = "ok"`; `spec` field per profession | keep `todo`, no spec column |
| Blueprints / camp objects in the window? | "Recipe categories" (names + examples) | camp planner (P6) becomes possible later | stays parked |

Verified in Forever's API source (5 Nov): `C_TradeSkillUI.GetRecipeSchematic`
(recipeSpellID, isRecraft) → `reagentSlotSchematics[].reagents[].itemID` and
`quantityRequired`; `GetShowLearned`/`GetShowUnlearned`;
`C_SpellBook.IsSpellKnown`. `GetCategoryInfo` is not in the generated docs
but Forever's own `Blizzard_Professions.lua` calls it, so it is probed, not
assumed. Specialisation spell IDs agree on wowhead.com/classic and
classicdb.ch (two sources); the game still has to confirm them.

### Answers so far (owner's v0.2.7 report, 5 Nov, level 1 character with no profession)
- All probed APIs exist in game; the window filter defaults to "show unlearned = no".
- Specialisations: all 10 IDs have the right names in game → confirmed (`status = "ok"`).
- 6 Nov (Herbalism 4/75): **unlearned recipes are listed** (Nobody knows
  works); **Herbalism has a "Camping" category** (Seed Hybridizer,
  Greenhouse, Incense Candle), so gathering professions have recipes;
  reagents come back for an unlearned recipe with the window open; category
  names work. The bundled display font failed to load (fixed in v0.3.0 by
  preloading it, to be confirmed).
- Still open: reagents with the window closed; `IsSpellKnown` for a spec owner.
- **v0.3.1 (7 Nov, owner asked):** every recipe in the game, bundled from the
  game's own data tables via wago.tools (`tools/recipes.js` → `Data/Recipes.lua`,
  IDs only), search by name / group / material, Wowhead links, Getting started.
  This replaced the "share each window's list over sync" idea (no protocol change).
  Wowhead itself isn't used as a data source (its terms forbid copying it).
  Later from the same data: where each recipe comes from (trainer / item).
- **Camp planner (P6) is now possible**: the camping recipes, their
  categories and reagents are all readable. Candidate for v0.3.x/v0.5,
  only if the owner asks.

### Proposed default order (owner to confirm the guild's top 3)
1. **Guild coverage board + one-profession view** (crafters with skill and
   "recorded 3d ago", recipe list with crafter counts, filters). Builds on
   data everyone already sends; biggest everyday use.
2. **Reagents** in the Crafters side panel and profession view (local, plus
   "you have 3 / need 5" from your bags).
3. **Cooldown board** (who can transmute / make cloth now). `cds` already syncs.
4. Favourites (stars, local only).
5. Specialisations (only once the probe confirms the IDs).
6. Freshness nudges ("Tailoring went from 240 to 262, open the window").

### What went into v0.3.0 (built 5 Nov, not released)
- All six above. No new message types; guildmates on v0.2.5+ keep working.
  New profile field `profs[skillLine].specs` (list of up to 4 spell IDs,
  checked in `Merge.FIELDS`; older versions ignore it). Favourites,
  reagents and nudge state are local only.
- Reminders: +15 skill since the last scan; chat at most once per session
  and once every 3 days; Settings toggle; also shown on the tab.
- Not done: tooltip specialisation lines (item 8 of the prompt), because
  which item needs which specialisation isn't verified data.
- **v0.3.1 (only if asked):** craft requests (D1, a new message type).
- **Later:** shopping list (D6), camp planner (P6) if the categories show
  camp objects, "where to get it" (D4) only with a verified data source.

## 12. Roadmap review (7 Nov 2026, after v0.3.6)

Where we are: professions (v0.3.x) are done and the sync fix is out. The guild
is **levelling** (owner level 15; 27 members, 8 sharing data), and raids
open on **9 Dec**. The owner asked what to build next.

### Recommended now
| # | What | Why now | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | built and released in v0.4.0, **removed again in v0.4.1** (8 Nov: "not set up right yet; keep it as crafting and professions for now") **Raids tab, read-only** | The 9 Dec deadline; needs time for in-game testing | L | `docs/prompts/next-v0.4-raids.md`: calendar events, who signed up with spec, role, ilvl, attunement, role counts, readiness card. Nothing new on the wire except a main/second role in the profile |
| 2 | **API safety check in CI (P17)** | Agreed on 2 Nov, never built. A Forever patch that renames an API would break things silently | S | CI compares every API the addon calls against Blizzard's Forever source |
| 3 | **Levelling buddies** (new) | The guild is levelling *now*; data is already there (roster level, zone, online) | S | Overview card: "Online near your level (±3)": name, level, zone, Whisper and **Invite** (button press only; `C_PartyInfo.InviteUnit`). No new sync |
| 4 | **"Ask them to install" button** (new) | Adoption is the real bottleneck (8 of 27 share data) | S | Next to "Not seen with the addon yet": pre-types a guild-chat line with the CurseForge link; you press Enter (never sent automatically) |
| 5 | **Craft requests (D1)** | Professions are the guild's top priority; the natural next step | M | "Ask to craft" in Crafters; the crafter gets a request list with reagent totals and marks it done. New message type, owner-only |
| 6 | **Shopping list (D6)** | Builds on reagents and favourites | S–M | Pick recipes and quantities, see total reagents and "have / need" from your bags. Local only |
| 7 | **Automatic "my alts"** | Only if the owner's Warband currency test lists alts | S | `C_CurrencyInfo.FetchCurrencyDataFromAccountCharacters` → automatic claims |

### Keep for later (unchanged reasons)
Raid actions (sign-up buttons, invite everyone; v0.4.1, after v0.4.0 is
tested); lockout board (P15, needs raids and a verified API); status line
(P8, first free text on the wire); attendance (D2); Onyxia step tracker
(P10, needs verified quest IDs); camp planner (P6, needs verified data);
guild bank viewer (D5); loot history (D3, prefer Gargul); `!sr` chat
lookups (D7, `SendChatMessage` is restricted).

### Not planned
Same list as section 7, plus: no automatic alt detection beyond the
player's own account (addons can't see other players' accounts; confirmed by
research on 7 Nov).

## 13. Levelling tools (11 Nov 2026)

The owner saw Profession Master (CurseForge, All Rights Reserved, already
supports Forever) and wants similar tools, built in this order. **Only WoW
Forever data, never Retail or Classic; aim for the cheapest and most
efficient route on Forever.**

1. ✅ **Levelling helper** (v0.4.4, released 11 Nov): skill-up colours from Forever's
   SkillLineAbility, learned recipes only, checked against the game's own
   colours.
2. ✅ **Shopping list** (v0.4.5, released 11 Nov): recipes and crafts → total
   reagents, have (bags + bank via `C_Item.GetItemCount`) / still to get,
   "you make it" for reagents a learned recipe makes, Copy. Local only.
   Prices moved to step 3 (a vendor's *buy* price isn't readable away from
   the vendor; the item's sell price is).
3. **Profit:** crafting cost vs selling price. Prices from Auctionator's
   public API when it's installed (it is allowed to be called), else vendor
   prices only. Our own auction scan only if Auctionator isn't an option.
4. **Cheapest route:** from your skill to the next cap, choosing recipes by
   expected cost per skill-up (orange 1 point; yellow and green by chance),
   using 1–3. Limits: when trainers teach recipes and what they cost isn't in
   Forever's data, so the planner works from recipes you've learned (and, if
   the in-game window lists unlearned recipes with their requirement, those).
